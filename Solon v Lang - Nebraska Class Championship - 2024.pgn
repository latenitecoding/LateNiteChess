It looks counterintuitive to double the pawns and open the g-file, but the pawn on f4 is safe to take. That doubled pawn can then further reinforce e5, so after something like c5-dxc5, the pawn on e5 remains protected.}  (18. gxf4 {[%eval +1.42] }  ) Nf8 19. Rfe1 Ng6 20. Bf1 Qg5 21. Qg2 c5 22. dxc5 dxc4 23. Bxc4 Nxe5 {[%eval +3.04] } 24. Bxe5? {[%eval +0.17] Missed an opportunity to win additional material with h4. The queen is tied to the defense of the knight. A direct attack on the queen, and she has no good squares to retreat to.}  (24. h4 {[%eval +3.37] }  Qf5 25. Rxe5 Bxe5 26. gxf4+ {This is one of white's hidden resources. If g7, g5, and g3 are cleared, then white has a discovered check. That seems like a difficult task, but black has no choice since the bishop on g7 and the queen on g5 are both tied to the defense of the same piece. h4 moves the queen. Rxe5 moves the bishop. White then has gxf4 to move the pawn with a discovered check.} Qg6 27. Bxe5 {[%eval +5.32] White has two pieces and a pawn for the rook.}) Bxe5 {[%eval +0.10] } 25. gxf4 Bxf4 26. Rd7 Rec8 27.
